		<p>BusinessReach is a Silicon Valley based Business Networking
			Services Company. We founded BusinessReach to enable people in business and
			companies to connect with each other to drive the speed of business.</p>
			
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			
			<p>We are a team of Silicon Valley technologists and business
			leaders. We formed our experiences in the world of global companies that serve
			customers world-wide. We also recognized that the way business is done today,
			with paper, email, and isolated silos of information, hinders the speed with
			which we could conduct our roles and serve our customers. What drives us is the
			need to connect companies to form a seamless web of business relationships that
			enables information to be exchanged freely, without limitations of
			communications.</p>
