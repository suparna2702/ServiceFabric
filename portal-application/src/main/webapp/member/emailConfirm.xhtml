						Before you dive into your BusinessReach account, you need to
						confirm your email address. This helps us to filter out spam, bots
						and other nastiness from our online communities. When you signed
						up, an activation email was sent to the email address you
						specified when signing up. <strong>Check your inbox and
							locate the confirmation email.</strong> Click on the activation link in
						the email to confirm your email address. You may want to check
						your spam folder in case the activation email ended up there. We
						do our best to make sure emails arrive in your inbox, but
						sometimes they don't. If you don't see the email immediately,
						check back within a day or so, in case it has been temporarily
						held by your email provider. If you run into any other issues with
						validating your email address, please reach out to <strong>response-team@businessreach-inc.com.</strong>
